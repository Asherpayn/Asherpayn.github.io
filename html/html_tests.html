		<p>Portal 1 and Portal 2 are two of the most critically acclaimed video games of all time.</p>
		<p>Portal 1, released in 2007, introduced players to the mind-bending world of Aperture Science, where they guided the protagonist Chell through a series of challenging puzzles using a portal gun.</p>
		<p>Portal 2, released in 2011, expanded on the original's success, adding new gameplay mechanics, a co-op mode, and a darkly comedic narrative that explored the crumbling Aperture Science facility.</p>
